## 🎮 Who I Am

I’m **Eslam**, a **game developer** with a computer science background and a deep love for how games *work under the hood*.

I didn’t get into games just to make things look nice —  
I got into them because I’m obsessed with:
- **gameplay systems**
- **rules interacting with rules**
- and the moment when math, code, and player input *click* into something fun.

I enjoy working close to the metal when needed (C++, OpenGL, SFML),  
and higher-level tools when they serve the design (Unity).

To me, a good game is not an accident — it’s an **engineered experience**.

---

## 🧠 How I Think About Games

I care deeply about:
- 🧩 **System clarity** → mechanics that are easy to learn, hard to master  
- ⚙️ **Clean architecture** → code that survives iteration  
- 🎯 **Player feedback** → every action should *mean* something  
- 🚀 **Performance & control** → understanding what the engine is doing  

I enjoy prototyping ideas quickly, then refining them until they feel *right*.

  <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=cpp,c,cs,unity,opengl,git,github,python&theme=dark" />
</p>

**Main Tools**
- 🎮 **Unity** — gameplay logic, UI systems, mobile & PC builds  
- ⚙️ **C++ / SFML** — custom engines, gameplay loops, 2D systems  
- 🎨 **OpenGL** — shaders, rendering experiments, visual effects  
- 🧠 **Python / AI** — computer vision & ML experiments

## 🚀 Selected Projects & Game Work

### 🟢 Unity Games
- Mobile and PC game projects  
- Player controllers, menus, scene flow, game states  
- Portrait ↔ landscape handling, UI scaling, progression systems  

These projects focus on **feel**, **clarity**, and **clean structure**.

---

### 🔵 C++ / SFML / Low-Level Projects
- 2D games and gameplay prototypes written from scratch  
- Procedural placement systems, obstacles, level generation  
- Tight control over rendering, collisions, and update loops  

These projects sharpen how I think about **engines**, not just games.

---

### 🟣 AI & Experimental Work
- Computer vision models for medical image classification  
- GAN-based data augmentation experiments  
- Exploring how AI systems could inspire future gameplay mechanics  

This work feeds my curiosity about **AI-driven game systems**.

## 🌊 What I’m Aiming For

I want to:
- build **strong gameplay foundations**
- work on games where systems matter
- and keep growing toward **technical game development & engine-level work**

I’m always learning — graphics, AI, architecture, design — because games sit at the intersection of all of them.
